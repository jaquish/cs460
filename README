lab2 - loader     - Loader program, given a filepath, copies blocks into data(?) segment
lab3 - multitask  - A simple multitasking OS with sleep/wait/kexit, process management.

Other Important Folders

images - saved disk images, which contain professor's (kcw) binaries, empty floppy image
mp     - mount point for disk images. keep empty, used by make scripts.
out    - output folder for finished products (lab1.fdd, etc)
